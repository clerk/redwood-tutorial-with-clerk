[![Open in Visual Studio Code](https://open.vscode.dev/badges/open-in-vscode.svg)](https://open.vscode.dev/clerkinc/redwood-tutorial-with-clerk) [![Clerk documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/documentation-clerk-green.svg)](https://docs.clerk.dev) [![@ClerkDev on Twitter](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/ClerkDev?style=social)](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=ClerkDev)

This repo is based on a fork of the official [Redwood Tutorial repo](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood-tutorial) and represents the final state of the app created during the [Redwood Tutorial](https://redwoodjs.com/tutorial) with the addition of Clerk as the authentication provider.

You can follow along with [this guide](https://clerk.dev/tutorials/redwoodjs-tutorial-with-clerk) to integrate Clerk with RedwoodJS. You can also use this repo as the basis for further exploration with Redwood. Happy trails! ðŸŒ²
