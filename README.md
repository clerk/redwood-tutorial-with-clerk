This repo is based on a fork of the official [Redwood Tutorial repo](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood-tutorial) and represents the final state of the app created during the [Redwood Tutorial](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/tutorial/foreword) with the addition of Clerk as the authentication provider.

You can follow along with [this guide](https://clerk.dev/tutorials/redwoodjs-blog-tutorial-with-clerk?utm_source=github&utm_medium=redwood_tutorial) to integrate Clerk with RedwoodJS. You can also use this repo as the basis for further exploration with Redwood. Happy trails! ðŸŒ²
